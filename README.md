# DAppNode package _Web3signer_

<!--DAppNode package logo (could be added with an hyperlink to a youtube video): -->

![](node-avatar.png)

<!--Brief introduction about the source project (official project definition is an option): -->

A validator client contributes to the consensus of the Eth2 blockchain by signing proposals and attestations of blocks, using a BLS private key which must be available to this client at all times.

The BLS remote signer API is designed to be consumed by validator clients, looking for a more secure avenue to store their BLS12-381 private key(s), enabling them to run in more permissive and scalable environments.

More information about the EIP can be found at [the official website](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3030)

### Why _Web3signer_ ?
